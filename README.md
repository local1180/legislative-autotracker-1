# Legislative Auto Tracker

This is a "Proof of Concept" project that is being supplanted by a more modular design using FireStore as a backend.  See the new project in action at https://legislative-autotracker.firebaseapp.com/

This project is intended to be a simple drop-in web app to assist CWA Union locals in:
* tracking state level priority legislation;
* communicating the status of said legislation to Local membership;
* providing an easy way for Local members to identify & contact their state legislators in support of said legislation.

While currently applicable only to CWA District 1-NY (the initial developer's home territory), the intent is to modularize the state-specific functionality and build out to each and every state for which a legislative API exists.
